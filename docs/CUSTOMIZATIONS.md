# Repository customizations

This deployment tracks a reviewed upstream release tag. The intended supported
customization boundary contains only three local operational extensions:

1. **Blue-green deployment**
   - `deploy/blue-green-deploy.sh`
   - `deploy/BLUE_GREEN.md`
   - `deploy/tests/blue-green-deploy-test.sh`
2. **Automatic low-balance recharge**
   - `deploy/sub2api-auto-recharge.py`
   - `deploy/sub2api-auto-recharge.service`
   - `deploy/sub2api-auto-recharge.timer`
   - `deploy/tests/test-auto-recharge-runtime.py`
3. **Cockpit token synchronization**
   - `tools/cockpit-token-sync/`
   - the minimal account/quota service integration required by that syncer

Everything else should continue to follow upstream. In particular, image model
routing, model defaults, retry policy, migrations, API behavior, and normal CI
workflows are upstream-owned. However, the `0.2.13-custom.1` rollout branch
still carries legacy downstream backend fixes and local tooling inherited from
the deployed `0.2.8-custom.1` image. They are retained for this rollout to
avoid an unreviewed behavior change, not approved as permanent extensions.
Audit and remove or upstream them in a separate verified change; until then,
do not assume this branch differs from upstream in only three places. The
production image currently uses upstream's
`gpt-5.6-luna` Responses driver for the `gpt-image-2` image tool, with
`SUB2API_IMAGES_MAIN_MODEL` available as the upstream-provided override.

The following are deliberately not part of this customization layer:

- the former retry-count change from 5 to 10;
- prompt or response capture;
- account-specific operational skills;
- a repository-scheduled production auto-deploy workflow.

## Updating from upstream

1. Fetch and integrate the selected upstream release tag in an isolated worktree.
2. Resolve conflicts, preserve the three supported extensions, and review any
   remaining legacy differences against the tagged upstream source.
3. Run the blue-green, recharge, Cockpit sync, and relevant Go test suites.
4. Build a `linux/amd64` image in CI or on a separate build host.
5. Back up production, then deploy the prebuilt image with the blue-green
   script and verify public health plus a real feature smoke test.

Never build source code or container images on the Los Angeles production
server. A Codex heartbeat may periodically inspect upstream and recommend an
update, but it must not deploy without explicit confirmation.

## Runtime provider configuration

Production provider accounts are configured through the existing admin API;
they do not add source customizations. See [BigModel GLM](BIGMODEL.md) for the
verified account, group model allowlist, client usage, and rollback record.
