# Blue-Green Docker Deployment

`blue-green-deploy.sh` deploys an already-built `linux/amd64` image beside the
running application, waits for the candidate to pass its Docker health check
and `/health` probe, then switches Caddy without restarting it.

The script intentionally does not run `docker build`, `docker compose down`, or
`docker pull`. Build the image in CI, verify it, and load it on the server
before invoking the script. PostgreSQL and Redis remain the existing shared
services; only the application container is replaced.

## One-time Caddy preparation

The production Caddy site must have two application upstreams configured with
health-aware primary/secondary routing. The current production Caddyfile is a
custom file outside this repository, so prepare that file once before the
first rollout. Keep the existing host block and replace its Sub2API proxy
block with the following shape:

```caddyfile
reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080 {
    lb_policy first
    health_uri /health
    health_interval 2s
    health_fails 2
    health_passes 2
    health_timeout 5s
    lb_try_duration 5s
    stream_close_delay 5m
}
```

Validate and reload Caddy; do not restart the Caddy container. The deployment
script replaces only the direct `reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:<port>` line inside
the site identified by `SUB2API_CADDY_SITE_HOST`.

## First rollout from the current single container

The first run treats the existing `sub2api` container on port `8080` as blue
and starts green on `18081`:

```bash
export SUB2API_CADDY_SITE_HOST='sub2api.example.com:8443'
export SUB2API_CADDYFILE=/opt/sub2api-https/Caddyfile
export SUB2API_CADDY_CONTAINER=sub2api-https

./blue-green-deploy.sh sub2api:dev-<commit>
```

The target image must already be loaded locally and must report
`linux/amd64`. The script records the active slot in
`/opt/sub2api/deploy/.blue-green-active`, keeps the Caddy backup next to the
Caddyfile, and leaves the old container stopped rather than deleting it.

The next rollout alternates ports: blue uses `8080`, green uses `18081`.
Only one deployment can run at a time because the script takes a host lock.
After the first rollout, do not run `docker compose up -d sub2api` for the
application service: Compose may resurrect the stopped legacy container on
port `8080`. Use this script for application image updates; Compose can still
manage PostgreSQL and Redis.

## Real-request gate

Optionally set `SUB2API_PRE_CUTOVER_CHECK` to an absolute executable script.
After candidate health succeeds and before changing Caddy, the deployer calls
it with the candidate host port and container name as its two arguments.
Use it for real model, streaming and billing checks against the candidate.
A nonzero exit stops the deployment and removes only the failed candidate;
the original active route and container remain available. Keep credentials
in private files rather than the command line or script output.

## Safety boundaries

- The candidate gets a copied `/app/data` directory so two application
  versions do not concurrently write the same files. Freeze file-backed config
  edits during the short copy and deployment window.
- Both versions use the same PostgreSQL and Redis services. Database migrations
  must be backward-compatible while both versions overlap; use expand/contract
  migrations and keep a database backup before a schema-changing release.
- Host automation that calls the private application API must resolve the
  active container and port from `.blue-green-active`. The source-managed
  low-balance job is `sub2api-auto-recharge.py`; do not hardcode port `8080` in
  scheduled jobs.
- Caddy is switched only after candidate health and a monitor window pass. If
  either step fails, Caddy is restored and the old container remains available.
- Existing long-lived requests are given a drain window. The application’s
  shutdown timeout should be at least as long as the container stop grace
  period when streaming requests must survive a release.
