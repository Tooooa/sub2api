## [ERR-20260911-003] cleanup-command-used-parent-directory

**Logged**: 2026-09-11T12:04:56+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
The temporary worktree cleanup succeeded, but the chained branch-delete command used `/Users/mayiding/Desktop/GitMy` instead of the repository path and therefore did not run.

### Error
```
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

### Context
- The command used `git -C /Users/mayiding/Desktop/GitMy branch -d ...` after removing the two explicit `/tmp` worktrees.
- No branch or remote state was changed by the failed delete step; the intended local temporary branches were deleted in a corrected command.

### Suggested Fix
Pass `/Users/mayiding/Desktop/GitMy/sub2api` as `-C` for every repository operation and verify the path before chaining cleanup commands.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: .git/worktrees, .learnings/ERRORS.md

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-09-11T12:05:30+08:00
- **Commit/PR**: current synchronization run
- **Notes**: Re-ran branch deletion from the explicit repository path; only the two merged temporary branches were removed.

## [ERR-20260912-001] github-ssh-fetch

**Logged**: 2026-09-12T11:03:32+08:00
**Priority**: medium
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
Command-scoped SSH fetches to GitHub were closed by the remote endpoint.

### Error
```
Connection closed by 20.205.243.166 port 22
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

### Context
- Attempted to refresh `upstream/main` and `origin/main`/`origin/dev` using explicit SSH repository URLs.
- Configured HTTPS remotes were unchanged.

### Suggested Fix
Retry through the temporary VPN HTTP proxy used by prior automation runs, then remove proxy variables after the fetch.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: unknown
- Related Files: none

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-09-12T11:05:00+08:00
- **Commit/PR**: pending
- **Notes**: Retried the same refspecs through the temporary VPN HTTP proxy; `upstream/main`, `origin/main`, and `origin/dev` refreshed successfully. Proxy variables were command-scoped and not persisted.

## [ERR-20260911-002] chained-merge-used-parent-checkout

**Logged**: 2026-09-11T11:10:42+08:00
**Priority**: high
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
After creating an isolated worktree in a chained shell command, the following `git merge` ran in the parent checkout and advanced local `dev` unexpectedly.

### Error
```
dev advanced from 4f5c4fa33 to 929ddcb6c via merge upstream/main
```

### Context
- `git worktree add ... && git merge ...` was executed with the parent checkout as the command working directory.
- The new worktree was created correctly, but the chained merge inherited the parent directory instead of entering the new worktree.
- The remote `origin/dev` was not changed; the accidental merge commit was retained before correction.

### Suggested Fix
Use `git -C <worktree> merge ...` or a separate command with an explicit worktree working directory after every worktree creation.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: .git/worktrees, .learnings/ERRORS.md

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-09-11T11:14:00+08:00
- **Commit/PR**: current synchronization run
- **Notes**: Saved the accidental merge under a backup branch and restored local `dev` to `origin/dev` before continuing in the isolated worktree.

## [ERR-20260911-001] git-command-scoped-remote-url-override

**Logged**: 2026-09-11T11:05:23+08:00
**Priority**: medium
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
Setting `remote.<name>.url` with `git -c` did not override the configured HTTPS URL for fetches in this checkout.

### Error
```
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api.git/': LibreSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/MaYiding/sub2api.git/': LibreSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL
```

### Context
- The checkout has HTTPS `origin` and `upstream` remotes and recurring HTTPS/TLS failures.
- A parallel fetch attempt used command-scoped `remote.origin.url` and `remote.upstream.url` values, but Git still contacted the configured HTTPS endpoints.
- No ref or remote configuration changed.

### Suggested Fix
Use command-scoped `url.<ssh-url>.insteadOf` rewrites (or an explicit temporary repository URL) and verify the resulting refs after fetch.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: .git/config, .learnings/ERRORS.md

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-09-11T11:07:00+08:00
- **Commit/PR**: current synchronization run
- **Notes**: Refreshed both remotes successfully with the temporary VPN HTTP proxy; no remote or global Git configuration was changed.

## [ERR-20260910-001] gh-defaulted-to-upstream-repository

**Logged**: 2026-09-10T16:55:48+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
An unqualified `gh pr` query targeted the source repository instead of this fork in a multi-remote checkout.

### Error
```
gh pr view 92 returned Wei-Shaw/sub2api pull request #92 rather than MaYiding/sub2api pull request #92
```

### Context
- The checkout has both `origin` (the fork) and `upstream` (the source repository).
- GitHub CLI repository inference selected `Wei-Shaw/sub2api`, so the read-only PR metadata was valid but belonged to the wrong repository.
- No repository or remote state changed before the mismatch was detected.

### Suggested Fix
Pass `-R MaYiding/sub2api` to every fork PR, workflow, and issue query; use `-R Wei-Shaw/sub2api` only for an intentional source-repository query.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: .git/config

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-09-10T16:55:48+08:00
- **Commit/PR**: current synchronization run
- **Notes**: Re-ran PR #92 and the open-PR listing with an explicit fork repository and continued from the correct results.

## [ERR-20260909-002] concurrent-worktree-merge-autostash

**Logged**: 2026-09-09T11:43:00+08:00
**Priority**: medium
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
A main-to-dev merge was interrupted because another automation briefly modified and committed files in the same checkout between the clean-status check and the merge.

### Error
```
fatal: stash failed
```

### Context
- The checkout was clean when the dev synchronization branch was created.
- A concurrent automation was completing the provider-count compatibility fix in the same working tree.
- Git observed transient working-tree changes while starting the merge; the concurrent automation committed them moments later and the worktree returned to clean state.

### Suggested Fix
Recheck the branch and worktree immediately before every write operation in shared automation checkouts, and retry only after confirming the concurrent commit is preserved remotely.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: timing-dependent
- Related Files: .git/index, .learnings/ERRORS.md
- See Also: ERR-20260829-002

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-09-09T11:44:00+08:00
- **Commit/PR**: current main-to-dev synchronization PR
- **Notes**: Verified the concurrent fix was committed and merged through PR #90, confirmed a clean worktree, then retried the merge without discarding any changes.

## [ERR-20260909-001] upstream-provider-count-assertion

**Logged**: 2026-09-09T11:22:34+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: frontend

### Summary
An upstream Grok monitor test hard-coded eight provider buttons and failed after the fork added MiniMax as a ninth provider.

### Error
```
expected providerButtons to have a length of 8 but got 9
```

### Context
- The upstream test correctly validated Grok availability and defaults but assumed the upstream-only provider catalog size.
- The merged fork catalog legitimately includes MiniMax, so the rendered grid and `PROVIDERS` both contain nine entries.

### Suggested Fix
Assert the rendered button count against the shared `PROVIDERS.length` source of truth while keeping provider-specific assertions explicit.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: frontend/src/views/admin/__tests__/ChannelMonitorView.grok.spec.ts, frontend/src/constants/channelMonitor.ts

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-09-09T11:23:10+08:00
- **Commit/PR**: #90
- **Notes**: Replaced the literal count with `PROVIDERS.length`; the focused Grok test passed.

## [ERR-20260902-002] local-env-secret-output

**Logged**: 2026-09-02T11:28:00+08:00
**Priority**: high
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
A port-discovery command searched local `.env` files without redacting values and printed a development database credential into tool output.

### Error
```
deploy/.env:<line>:POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<redacted>
```

### Context
- The goal was only to confirm the backend/frontend and infrastructure ports before restarting services.
- The command included `deploy/.env` in an `rg` search for several configuration keys.
- The credential remained local to this task output and was not added to Git or sent to an external service.

### Suggested Fix
Read port defaults from the managed development script or print only configuration key names; never search or display `.env` values during diagnostics.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: deploy/.env, tools/sub2api-dev.sh

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-09-02T11:28:00+08:00
- **Commit/PR**: current main-to-dev sync PR
- **Notes**: Stopped inspecting `.env` values and retained only the script-declared port information for the remaining checks.

## [ERR-20260902-003] concurrent-pnpm-dependency-refresh

**Logged**: 2026-09-02T11:52:18+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: frontend

### Summary
Two local pnpm validation commands started concurrently and exposed that the system pnpm version could not safely refresh this repository's dependency tree.

### Error
```
ERR_PNPM_ABORTED_REMOVE_MODULES_DIR_NO_TTY
ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH
```

### Context
- Lint/typecheck and targeted-test/build validation were launched in parallel against the same frontend workspace.
- The branch switch left pnpm wanting to refresh `node_modules`; concurrent processes cannot safely own that operation.
- The installed pnpm 11 no longer reads `pnpm.overrides` from `package.json`, while this lockfile was generated with those overrides under pnpm 9.
- Repository integrity checks completed successfully and no source files were changed by the failed commands.

### Suggested Fix
Run validation sequentially when commands share one `node_modules` tree, and use pnpm 9 for frozen dependency restoration until the repository migrates its overrides configuration.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: frontend/package.json, frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-09-02T11:52:18+08:00
- **Commit/PR**: pending dev synchronization PR
- **Notes**: Restored dependencies with `pnpm@9.15.9 --frozen-lockfile`, then re-ran frontend validation sequentially.

## [ERR-20260902-001] git-rm-ignored-residual-file

**Logged**: 2026-09-02T11:20:00+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
`git rm` could not delete a `.DS_Store` file that an upstream merge had already removed from the index but left on disk as an ignored residual file.

### Error
```
fatal: pathspec '.DS_Store' did not match any files
```

### Context
- The pre-merge branch tracked the root `.DS_Store`, while upstream had already deleted it.
- The merge adopted the index deletion, but the ignored working-tree file remained physically present.
- A clean `git status` therefore did not imply that the ignored file was absent.

### Suggested Fix
Check both `git ls-files --error-unmatch <path>` and filesystem presence before choosing `git rm` versus ordinary ignored-file cleanup.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: .DS_Store, .gitignore

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-09-02T11:20:00+08:00
- **Commit/PR**: current upstream-sync PR
- **Notes**: Reclassified the residual as ignored local garbage and removed it with an ordinary filesystem deletion.

## [ERR-20260901-001] pnpm-non-tty-modules-rebuild

**Logged**: 2026-09-01T11:05:00+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: frontend

### Summary
The root frontend build could not start because pnpm attempted to rebuild `node_modules` in a non-interactive shell.

### Error
```
[ERR_PNPM_ABORTED_REMOVE_MODULES_DIR_NO_TTY] Aborted removal of modules directory due to no TTY
```

### Context
- Ran `make build` after merging the latest upstream `main`.
- Backend compilation completed successfully; the frontend target's implicit `pnpm install` was blocked before Vite/Vue compilation.

### Suggested Fix
Run `CI=true pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` explicitly (or invoke the repository-pinned pnpm version) before non-interactive frontend validation.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: frontend/package.json, frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml

## [ERR-20260831-001] git-rev-parse-verify-multiple-revisions

**Logged**: 2026-08-31T11:04:12+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
A branch-topology diagnostic passed multiple revisions to `git rev-parse --verify`, which accepts exactly one revision.

### Error
```
fatal: Needed a single revision
```

### Context
- The read-only command tried to verify `origin/main`, `origin/dev`, and `upstream/main` in one invocation.
- Later commands in the same diagnostic continued, but the first ancestry result was invalid because it inherited the failed command's exit status.
- No repository or remote state changed.

### Suggested Fix
Resolve each revision with a separate `git rev-parse` invocation before running ancestry checks.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: none

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-08-31T11:04:12+08:00
- **Commit/PR**: pending diagnostics PR
- **Notes**: Re-ran each revision lookup separately and confirmed that both fork branches contain `upstream/main`, while `dev` also contains fork `main`.

**Logged**: 2026-08-30T11:36:00+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
A patch used a generic Metadata block as context and added recurrence fields to the wrong error entry.

### Error
```
The recurrence fields appeared under ERR-20260830-001 instead of ERR-20260824-009.
```

### Context
- Many entries in `.learnings/ERRORS.md` contain identical `Reproducible` and `Related Files` lines.
- The post-patch diff exposed the misplaced fields before any commit or push.

### Suggested Fix
Anchor patches for repetitive Markdown logs with the unique entry heading as well as the local field context.

### Metadata

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-08-30T11:36:00+08:00

## [ERR-20260830-002] conflict-marker-scan-false-positive

**Logged**: 2026-08-30T11:07:19+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
A broad conflict-marker scan treated a legitimate source string made of equals signs as an unresolved Git conflict marker.

### Error
```
backend/internal/pkg/antigravity/request_transformer.go:274:===========================================`
```

### Context
- The scan used `^(<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>)`, which also matches longer separator strings.
- `git diff --check` passed, the merge was clean, and the source line was unrelated to the upstream changes.

### Suggested Fix
Match the full Git marker shape: `^<<<<<<< .+`, exactly seven equals signs, or `^>>>>>>> .+`.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-08-30T11:07:36+08:00

**Logged**: 2026-08-30T11:02:19+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
A read-only automation inspection assumed `date` lived at `/usr/bin/date`, but this macOS host exposes it at `/bin/date`.

### Error
```
zsh:2: no such file or directory: /usr/bin/date
```

### Context
- The command was gathering the current run timestamp alongside Git diagnostics.
- All repository reads in the same command completed; no repository or remote state changed.

### Suggested Fix
Resolve standard utilities through `command -v` or invoke `date` through `PATH` instead of hardcoding `/usr/bin/date`.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: none

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-08-30T11:02:19+08:00
- **Commit/PR**: pending dev maintenance PR
- **Notes**: Confirmed `date` resolves to `/bin/date` and continued with the portable command name.

## [ERR-20260829-001] git-push-github-https-reset

**Logged**: 2026-08-29T11:22:41+08:00
**Priority**: medium
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
GitHub reset the HTTPS connection while pushing the validated dev-sync branch, so the immediately following PR creation could not find the head ref.

### Error
```
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/MaYiding/sub2api.git/': Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
pull request create failed: GraphQL: Head sha can't be blank, Base sha can't be blank, No commits between dev and agent/sync-main-into-dev-20260829, Head ref must be a branch
```

### Context
- The branch was clean and had passed the complete local backend and frontend suites.
- The push failed before any remote ref was created; the PR command therefore had no valid head branch.
- The repository had previously recovered from the same GitHub HTTPS reset by pushing over SSH port 22.

### Suggested Fix
Retry with an explicit SSH repository URL and exact refspec, then create the PR only after confirming the remote branch exists. A one-shot `remote.<name>.url` config override did not bypass the configured HTTPS URL on this host.

**Area**: infra

### Summary
A duplicate-file cleanup patch used a previously enumerated list after another workspace process had already removed one target.

### Error
```
apply_patch verification failed: Failed to read .learnings/LEARNINGS 2.md: No such file or directory
```

### Context
- Nine numbered duplicate files were enumerated and verified against their canonical originals.
- Before the delete patch ran, at least one target disappeared and the active branch also changed, indicating concurrent workspace activity.
- The patch failed atomically before the subsequent Git fetch commands ran.

### Suggested Fix
Re-enumerate numbered duplicates immediately before deletion and avoid batching stale targets when concurrent workspace activity is detected.

## [ERR-20260828-001] parallel-diagnostic-command-omission

**Logged**: 2026-08-28T11:02:18+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
A parallel diagnostic tuple stored only the arguments for a Git command, so zsh tried to execute `status` directly.

### Error
```
zsh:1: command not found: status
```

### Context
- A JavaScript orchestration tuple used `git` as the result label and `status --short ...` as the shell command.
- The shell call therefore omitted the `git` executable.
- The failed command was read-only; no repository or remote state changed.

### Suggested Fix
Keep display labels separate from complete, independently executable command strings in parallel diagnostic arrays.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: none

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-08-28T11:02:18+08:00

**Area**: tests

### Summary
The local integration suite hit a transient Testcontainers reaper-name collision while Go test packages were running concurrently.

### Error
```
Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/reaper_9cad487e74debd6dd449d663840bb909810cd2f88d993c371ebc2c924d9ff6db" is already in use

### Context
- Ran `go test -tags=integration ./...` after the tagged unit suite passed.
- `TestRateLimiterSetsTTLAndDoesNotRefresh` failed before its assertions while creating the Redis test container.
- The named reaper container had already disappeared by the time Docker was inspected, confirming it was transient test infrastructure rather than a persistent application container.

### Suggested Fix
Rerun the integration packages serially with `go test -p 1 -tags=integration ./...` after confirming the transient reaper container is gone.

### Summary
A malformed quote in a `functions.exec` JavaScript object prevented a GitHub label query from running.

### Error
```

**Logged**: 2026-08-26T07:56:29Z
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: backend

### Summary
A local tagged Go unit-test build transiently failed to open imports, including the standard-library `fmt` package, while frontend dependency reconstruction was running in parallel.

### Error
```
could not import fmt (open : no such file or directory)
could not import github.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api/ent/user (open : no such file or directory)
```

### Context
- Ran `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto make test-unit test-integration` after the latest upstream refresh.
- Most packages passed; only `internal/service_test` failed during compilation before its assertions ran.
- The untagged full Go suite had passed earlier, and GitHub CI for the same branch was still running without this compiler error.

### Suggested Fix
Rerun the tagged Go suites serially after the concurrent dependency reconstruction finishes; if the failure recurs, inspect and clean only the Go build cache before retrying.

### Metadata

**Logged**: 2026-08-26T07:55:37Z
**Priority**: medium
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: frontend

### Summary
Frontend validation again stopped before tests because pnpm required confirmation to rebuild `node_modules` after duplicate dependency directories were removed.

### Error
```
[ERR_PNPM_ABORTED_REMOVE_MODULES_DIR_NO_TTY] Aborted removal of modules directory due to no TTY
[ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH] Cannot proceed with the frozen installation.
```

### Context
- Ran `make test-frontend` after deleting 805 system-created dependency duplicates with numbered suffixes.
- The pnpm wrapper detected that the remaining modules directory needed rebuilding and refused the non-interactive purge.
- Retrying with global pnpm 11.5.0 and `CI=true` rebuilt the directory but ignored package-level overrides, so its frozen-lockfile check disagreed with the pnpm 9 lockfile.
- No frontend lint, typecheck, or Vitest assertion had run or failed yet.

### Suggested Fix
Use the CI-compatible pnpm 9.15.9 explicitly with `CI=true` for the frozen-lockfile install/rebuild and subsequent non-interactive frontend validation.

## [ERR-20260826-001] zsh-unmatched-root-glob

**Logged**: 2026-08-26T07:33:00Z
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
A read-only configuration search stopped early because zsh rejected unmatched root-level Docker Compose globs.

### Error
```
zsh:6: no matches found: docker-compose*.yml
```

### Context
- Searched project manifests and common port declarations after merging upstream `main`.
- Docker Compose files live under `deploy/`, so the root-level glob had no matches.
- Commands before the unmatched glob completed; the merge and working tree were unaffected.

### Suggested Fix
Use `find`/`rg --files` to enumerate optional files, or enable a null-glob locally instead of passing unmatched globs to zsh.

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-08-26T07:33:00Z
- **Commit/PR**: pending sync PR
- **Notes**: Continued discovery with `find`-resolved paths and avoided optional shell globs. The same root-level Compose glob recurred on 2026-08-30; subsequent scans enumerate candidate files with `rg --files` or `find` first.

**Logged**: 2026-08-23T03:06:34Z
**Priority**: medium

**Area**: infra

### Summary
The first push of the daily upstream-sync branch failed because GitHub reset the HTTPS connection.

### Error
```
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/MaYiding/sub2api.git/': Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
```

### Context
- Attempted to push `agent/sync-upstream-main-20260823` after a clean upstream merge and passing backend tests.
- The subsequent PR creation also failed because the branch did not yet exist on GitHub.
- GitHub CLI authentication was valid before the push.

### Suggested Fix
When GitHub HTTPS is reset but SSH authentication succeeds, rewrite the GitHub URL to SSH for that Git command only. Confirm the remote branch exists before creating the PR.

### Metadata

### Resolution

- **Commit/PR**: #57
- **Notes**: GitHub SSH authentication succeeded on ports 22 and 443; the 2026-08-24 through 2026-08-28 sync pushes/fetches and branch cleanup used a command-scoped `url.insteadOf` rewrite without changing the persistent remote. On 2026-08-30 and 2026-08-31, explicit SSH repository URLs and exact refspecs refreshed origin and upstream after HTTPS resets. GraphQL polling and one SSH push have also hit transient connection resets; retrying continues safely without changing repository state.

### Summary
Frontend validation could not start because pnpm required a non-interactive `node_modules` rebuild.

### Error
```
[ERR_PNPM_ABORTED_REMOVE_MODULES_DIR_NO_TTY] Aborted removal of modules directory due to no TTY
```

### Context
- Ran the frontend lint, typecheck, Vitest, and build commands after merging the latest upstream `main`.
- The existing `node_modules` metadata was produced by a different pnpm version, so the current pnpm wrapper attempted an implicit install and refused to purge dependencies without a TTY.

### Suggested Fix

**Area**: infra

### Summary
A parallel synchronization process changed branches and left a stale main-to-dev merge in progress while the upstream refresh was still advancing.

### Error
```
fatal: cannot switch branch while merging

### Context
- The pending merge targeted an older `origin/main` while upstream had already advanced again.
- Read-only inspection confirmed the merge had no manual conflict-resolution work to preserve.
- The stale merge was aborted only after verifying the branch HEAD, MERGE_HEAD, and worktree state.

### Suggested Fix
Before each branch transition in a shared automation workspace, inspect `git status`, `MERGE_HEAD`, and active Git processes; abort only a verified stale, uncommitted merge and restart from refreshed remote refs.

**Area**: infra

### Summary
A validation referenced a development script that does not exist on the main branch.

### Error
```

### Context
- `bash -n tools/sub2api-dev.sh` was run while validating the upstream merge on `main`.
- `tools/sub2api-dev.sh` is intentionally maintained only on this repository's custom `dev` branch.
- An initial diagnosis incorrectly attributed the failure to parallel working-directory interference; `git ls-tree` and branch history showed that the file is absent on `main`.

### Suggested Fix
Before validating a branch-specific tool, confirm it is tracked on the current branch. Run the development-manager syntax check after merging `main` into `dev`.

**Area**: frontend

### Summary
The managed Vite process kept routing through the wrong port target after the config default changed.

### Error
```

### Context
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` was changed from `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` and the frontend was restarted.
- The served config showed the IPv4 default, but requests through port 3000 still reached the unrelated Docker listener.
- The local manager already had the authoritative `BACKEND_URL` but did not pass it explicitly to Vite.

### Error
```

### Context
- `lsof -tiTCP:8080` returned both the managed IPv4 backend PID and Docker's IPv6 listener PID.
- The script passed the newline-separated PID list as one argument to `kill`, so neither listener was signaled.
- The screen session exited, but the managed backend process remained orphaned on `127.0.0.1:8080`.

**Area**: infra

### Summary
Sourcing `deploy/.env` alone does not define the runtime `DATABASE_*` variables used by the local development backend.

### Error
```
psql: error: connection to server on socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: FATAL:  database "mayiding" does not exist

### Context
- A read-only diagnostic command sourced `deploy/.env` and expected `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_USER`, and `DATABASE_DBNAME` to be present.
- `tools/sub2api-dev.sh load_env` derives those values from `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB`; sourcing the file without applying that mapping leaves the database variables unset.

## [ERR-20260914-002] conflict-scan-regex-false-positive

**Logged**: 2026-09-14T11:07:47+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
The first conflict-marker scan matched a legitimate long equals-sign string embedded in a Go source line.

### Error
```text
backend/internal/pkg/antigravity/request_transformer.go:274:===========================================`
```

### Context
- The scan used `^(<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>)`, which treats any line beginning with seven equals signs as a merge conflict.
- The repository contains a longer equals-sign separator followed by a backtick; no conflict marker was present.

### Suggested Fix
Match complete Git marker lines only: `^(<<<<<<< |>>>>>>> |=======$)`.

### Summary
The first push of the diagnostics branch was reset by GitHub over the configured HTTPS remote.

### Error
```text

### Context
- The local branch `agent/diagnostics-20260914` was committed successfully as `7af83b612`.
- The direct `git push -u origin agent/diagnostics-20260914` failed before any remote ref update.

### Suggested Fix

**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
The GitHub CLI check watcher terminated after an unexpected EOF from the GraphQL API while CI was still running.

### Error
```text
Post "https://api.github.com/graphql": unexpected EOF
```

### Context
- `gh pr checks 104 --watch` had already observed shell, frontend, security, and lint results.
- The watcher exited during a status refresh; the associated CI run remained `in_progress` with integration tests active.

### Suggested Fix
Treat watcher EOF as a transport interruption, then re-query the run with a fresh command-scoped proxy session before making any CI or merge decision.

**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
An empty `apply_patch` probe was rejected before any repository change.

### Error
```text
patch rejected: empty patch
```

### Context
- The automation invoked `apply_patch` with only the begin/end markers before creating the sync worktree.
- The patch tool correctly rejected the no-op input; no file or Git state changed.

### Suggested Fix
Call `apply_patch` only for concrete file edits; Git merge and worktree operations do not require an empty patch preflight.

**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
A diagnostics append used a `dev`-only context line while editing a branch based on `main`.

### Error
```text
apply_patch verification failed: Failed to find expected lines
```

### Context
- The expected anchor came from the original `dev` checkout's newer `.learnings/ERRORS.md`.
- The isolated upstream-sync worktree is based on `origin/main`, whose fork diagnostics history is intentionally older.
- The failed patch made no file changes.

### Suggested Fix
Read the target worktree's file before patching branch-specific diagnostics instead of reusing context from another branch.

**Priority**: high
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
A merge chained after `git worktree add` still ran in the original checkout and temporarily advanced local `dev`.

### Error
```text
## dev...origin/dev [ahead 45]
```

### Context
- `git worktree add <path> ... && git merge ...` does not change the shell working directory after creating the worktree.
- The merge was clean, remained local, and was detected before any push.
- The accidental commit was preserved on `backup/accidental-dev-sync-20260915` before restoring `dev` to `origin/dev`.

### Suggested Fix
Run every isolated-worktree command with that worktree as the command runner's explicit `workdir`, or use `git -C <worktree> ...`.

**Area**: infra

### Summary
The first recovery branch command used an invalid guessed expansion of a short commit SHA.

### Error
```text

### Context
- A 9-character displayed SHA was incorrectly extended instead of resolving the exact object ID.
- Git rejected the branch command before any branch, checkout, or working-tree change.

### Suggested Fix
Always obtain the full object ID with a separate `git rev-parse <ref>` call before using exact-SHA recovery operations.

**Priority**: high

**Area**: infra

### Summary
An invalid awk regular expression failed inside command substitution while the wrapper still printed a false duplicate-scan success line.

### Error
```text
awk: nonterminated character class
duplicate_artifacts=none
```

### Context
- The awk regex used an unescaped slash inside a slash-delimited character class.
- The failing command was inside an assignment, and the subsequent empty-string check allowed the wrapper to exit successfully.
- No files were changed or deleted.

### Suggested Fix
Use `git ls-files` piped to `rg` with an explicit no-match allowance, and do not let a producer failure be interpreted as an empty successful result.

### Context
- PR #105 head `c54d2cd7bb161451ed33a5705ce7176cc6d1f17f` triggered equivalent push and pull-request CI workflows.
- Pull-request run `34923819853` passed unit and integration tests; push run `34923806042` failed only this cleanup assertion.

**Priority**: high
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: infra

### Summary
A health wrapper continued after curl connection failures and reported two empty response bodies as matching.

### Error
```text

curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 3000

```

### Context
- Backend and frontend had no listeners, so both body-fetching curl commands failed.
- The wrapper did not stop on those failures and hashed two empty shell variables to the same SHA-256 value.
- PostgreSQL 5432 and Redis 6379 remained healthy; no application restart was attempted because the required script compiles locally.

### Suggested Fix
Require both curl commands to succeed and return HTTP 200 before hashing bodies; report body equality only after those preconditions pass.

### Summary
The `dev` synchronization CI failed because a cherry-picked quota test still called `NewOpenAIQuotaService` with the pre-referral constructor signature.

### Error

### Context
- PR #114 transplanted the maintained operations customization commits from conflicting PR #95 onto the latest `dev` baseline.
- Conflict resolution combined the latest referral client dependency with the customization's temporary-unschedulable cache wiring.
- Static review checked `ProvideOpenAIQuotaService` call sites but did not enumerate every direct `NewOpenAIQuotaService` test constructor call before the first push.

### Suggested Fix
After resolving constructor or provider conflicts during a cherry-pick, enumerate both provider and direct constructor call sites across the repository before pushing, then let remote CI perform compilation and tests.
